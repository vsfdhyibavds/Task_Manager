Generic single-database configuration.

# Task Manager CLI Application

## Description
This is a Command Line Interface (CLI) based Task Manager application built with Python. It allows users to register, login, and manage tasks and categories efficiently. The project uses Click for CLI commands, SQLAlchemy for ORM and database interactions, and Alembic for database migrations.

## Features
- User registration, login, and update
- Task creation, listing, detail viewing, updating, and deletion
- Category creation, listing, and deletion
- Database initialization with dummy data including users, priorities, categories, tasks, subtasks, and notes

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Database Initialization

Initialize the database and populate it with dummy data by running the following CLI command:

```bash
python main.py init
```

Alternatively, you can run the initialization script directly:

```bash
python init_db.py
```

## Usage

The CLI provides the following commands:

- `init` - Initialize the database
- `register` - Register a new user (prompts for username, email, password)
- `login` - Login a user (prompts for username, password)
- `update-user` - Update user details (prompts for user ID and optional fields)
- `add` - Add a new task (prompts for title, description, due date, priority ID, category ID, user ID)
- `list` - List all tasks for a user (prompts for user ID)
- `show` - Show task details including subtasks and notes (prompts for task ID and user ID)
- `delete` - Delete a task (prompts for task ID and user ID)
- `category-add` - Add a new category (prompts for name, color, user ID)
- `category-list` - List all categories for a user (prompts for user ID)
- `category-delete` - Delete a category (prompts for category ID and user ID)

Example usage:

```bash
python main.py register
python main.py add
python main.py list
```

## Testing

There is a test file `test_register_duplicate_email.py` to check for duplicate email registration scenarios.

## Notes

- Passwords are hashed in a simple manner for demonstration purposes. For production, use proper password hashing.
- The login command returns a dummy token.
- The database is initialized with sample data for priorities, users, categories, tasks, subtasks, and notes.
